# Runar â€‘ Rust Backend Framework

Runar is a lightweight, high-performance Rust framework for building **end-to-end encrypted, modular, and developer-friendly** back-end services. Due to its architecture it also makes it easy to build peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.

Runarâ€™s design blends battle-tested cryptography with an ergonomic API surface and mobile-wallet key management, enabling small teams to ship production-grade back-ends without a dedicated DevOps or security department.

## Why Runar?

* **End-to-End Encryption with Self-Custodied Keys** â€“ Data stays encrypted from producer to consumer. Keys live in user-controlled mobile wallets or hardware (e.g. Ledger), and Runar automates exchange & rotation so developers get Signal-level security with almost zero extra code â€” and users enjoy password-less crypto they already trust.
* **Great Developer UX** â€“ Clean request/response APIs, a zero-boilerplate pub/sub system, and sensible defaults mean you can sketch an idea in minutes and iterate fast.
* **Modular Architecture** â€“ Enable only what you need.  First-party modules include:
  * **Web Gateway** â†’ REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket endpoints out-of-the-box
  * **Encrypted Storage** â†’ blazing-fast SQLite with transparent encryption
* **Mobile-first Embedding** â€“ The core can be linked directly into iOS/Android apps, powering fully offline-capable P2P experiences.
* **Zero-Ops Deployments** â€“ Ship a single static binary; no external DB or message broker required.
* **Zero-Copy Local Calls** â€“ Services compiled into the same binary talk via plain in-memory function calls. No cloning, no serialization, identical performance to native Rust.

### Quick Example

Runarâ€™s declarative macros let you expose functionality with just a few lines of code:

```rust
use anyhow::{anyhow, Result};
use runar_common::{hmap, types::ArcValue};
use runar_macros::{action, publish, service, subscribe};
use runar_node::{
    services::{EventContext, RequestContext},
    Node, NodeConfig,
};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

#[derive(Clone, Default)]
pub struct MathService;

#[service(
    name = "Math Service",
    path = "math",
    description = "Simple arithmetic API",
    version = "0.1.0"
)]
impl MathService {
    /// Add two numbers and publish the total to `math/added`.
    #[publish(path = "added")]
    #[action]
    async fn add(&self, a: f64, b: f64, ctx: &RequestContext) -> Result<f64> {
        ctx.debug(format!("Adding {a} + {b}"));
        Ok(a + b)
    }
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct StatsService {
    values: Arc<Mutex<Vec<f64>>>,
}

impl Default for StatsService {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            values: Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new())),
        }
    }
}

#[service(path = "stats")]
impl StatsService {
    /// Record a value
    #[action]
    async fn record(&self, value: f64, _ctx: &RequestContext) -> Result<()> {
        self.values.lock().unwrap().push(value);
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Return number of recorded values
    #[action]
    async fn count(&self, _ctx: &RequestContext) -> Result<usize> {
        Ok(self.values.lock().unwrap().len())
    }

    /// React to math/added events
    #[subscribe(path = "math/added")]
    async fn on_math_added(&self, total: f64, ctx: &EventContext) -> Result<()> {
        let _: () = ctx
            .request("stats/record", Some(ArcValue::new_primitive(total)))
            .await
            .expect("Call to stats/record failed");
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Create a minimal Node configuration
    let config = NodeConfig::new_with_generated_id("default_network");
    let mut node = Node::new(config).await?;

    // Register services
    node.add_service(MathService).await?;
    node.add_service(StatsService::default()).await?;

    // call math/add
    let params = ArcValue::new_map(hmap! { "a" => 1.0, "b" => 2.0 });
    let sum: f64 = node.request("math/add", Some(params)).await?;
    assert_eq!(sum, 3.0);

    // Query stats count
    let count: usize = node.request("stats/count", None::<ArcValue>).await?;
    assert_eq!(count, 1);
    println!("All good â€“ stats recorded {count} value(s)");
    Ok(())
}
```

### Monolith â†’ Microservices â€“ Local-First, Network-Transparent

Runar routes a request the fastest way possible, deciding at **runtime** whether it can stay in-process or must cross the network:

* **Single binary (monolith)** â€“ When all services are linked together, arguments are forwarded by reference; nothing is cloned or serialized.
* **Separate binaries/containers (microservices)** â€“ When you later split a service out, the *same* code keeps working. You only change the `NodeConfig` transport and let Runar handle encrypted serialization under the hood.

This lets you start with a blazing-fast monolith and migrate to microservices gradually, as real-world traffic or organizational boundaries demand â€“ no premature architecture decisions required.

```rust
// In tests or local tooling â€“ everything lives in one process
let mut node = Node::new(NodeConfig::in_memory()).await?;
node.add_service(MathService).await?;
let sum: f64 = node.request("math/add", Some(ArcValue::map(hmap!{"a"=>1.0,"b"=>2.0}))).await?;
```

Later, in production:

```rust
// math-service now runs remotely; only wiring changes
let mut node = Node::new(NodeConfig::quic(...)).await?;
let sum: f64 = node.request("math/add", None::<ArcValue>).await?;
```

Same service implementation, same API call â€“ just a different deployment topology.
