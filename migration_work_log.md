# Migration Work Log\n\nThis document tracks the progress of the Runar Project migration tasks.\n\n## Code Consolidation Analysis\n\nExamined duplicate packages and their functionality:\n\n1. rust-common: Contains ServiceInfo trait and utility module\n2. utils: Contains vmap macros and other utilities\n3. kagi_utils: Points to a non-existent directory\n4. kagi_node: Points to a non-existent directory\n5. test_service_info: Simple placeholder crate\n\nObservations:\n- Macro duplication exists between rust-node/src/vmap_macros.rs and rust-macros/src/vmap.rs\n- rust-node contains macros that may need to be moved to rust-macros\n- rust-common should be the central location for common utilities\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Begin by consolidating all common utilities into rust-common\n2. Move vmap macros from rust-node to rust-macros\n3. Fix references and dependencies\n4. Remove duplicate packages after verifying functionality
