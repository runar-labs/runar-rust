# Replication System Fix Mission

## Original Goals
1. **Remove sequence numbers and use timestamps for ordering** - Replace `sequence_number` field with `timestamp` for event ordering
2. **Add node_id to events for conflict resolution** - Ensure `source_node_id` is stored in events
3. **Preserve event IDs when syncing between nodes** - Don't generate new UUIDs when syncing, preserve original event IDs
  

tests
test_basic_replication_between_nodes
test_full_replication_between_nodes
test_mobile_simulator_replication
are all working.. and shuold continue working after each task.
check them between tasks and do not advance if any of these tests break.
test_event_tables_and_ordering is fialing due to order issue and shuold be fixed when  **Remove sequence numbers and use timestamps for ordering** -  is implemented..

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE IN TEH TESTS. only changes that are direcvtly related to youf changes.. like the field changes.. 

## Mistakes Made in Previous Attempts

### 1. **Introduced unnecessary `mark_event_processed` method**
- **Problem**: Added method that wasn't part of the original working system
- **Lesson**: Only change what's directly related to the specific goal
 

### 2. **Changed working event flow unnecessarily**
- **Problem**: Modified `handle_sqlite_event` flow that was already working
- **Lesson**: Don't fix what isn't broken
 

### 3. **Added `broadcast_replication_event` method**
- **Problem**: Added useless method that wasn't needed
- **Lesson**: Don't add features that aren't requested
 

### 4. **Made changes without testing incrementally**
- **Problem**: Made multiple changes at once without testing each change
- **Lesson**: Work on one task at the time and test before moving to other tasks
 

 
1. ✅ Make one change at a time
2. ✅ Test after each change
3. ✅ Only change what's directly related to the goal
4. ✅ Don't modify working code unnecessarily
5. ✅ Keep tests as baselines, only change what's required
